This is a semester long project for my computer science II class.
For said project, I chose to design a point calculator for the end of semester pt (physical training) test in ROTC.
This will allow you to input the names and scores of the students/people participating in the test and it will turn the 
scores into points and add them up.
After adding the points up, it will display all the people on a leaderboard based on the amount of points each person recieved.
It will also display anything that the person recieved based on points, like a pt ribbon or a specific lamp to put on the ribbon.
